SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM:

My Project Comprises of,
        ðŸ’ The fire and gas detection system is a smart safety solution designed to detect gas leaks (e.g., methane, CO, propane) and fire hazards (sudden temperature spikes).
        When a hazard is detected, the system triggers an alarm, activates LED indicators, and displays warnings buzzer sound.
        ðŸ’ The Theif Detection System can be used for safety purpose in Authorized Area Zones which works in base of laser detection.


FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

ðŸ”¹ Connect to Wi-Fi (ESP8266/NodeMCU) â†’ Send alerts to a mobile app
ðŸ”¹ Add an SMS alert system (GSM Module) â†’ Notify users via text message
ðŸ”¹ Integrate with smart home systems for automated safety actions
ðŸ”¹ A relay module can be used to automatically cut off power supply or activate an exhaust fan to reduce danger.
ðŸ”¹ SO on...
